# Hi, welcome to my profile!

I am Alberto Martino, a first-year BSc Politics and Data Science Student at the [London School of Economics](lse.ac.uk).

## About Me

🗺️ Hi! I am originally from Milan, Italy, where I have spent eighteen years of my life. In September 2022, I moved to London for my bachelor's degree, which I will be completing in 2025. 

🗣️ I have a strong interest in International Organisations and Global Affairs! In 2020, I won a competition organised by the European Commission, Bocconi University and LaRepublica Newspaper with a paper on the EU relations with the US and China.

## Current Projects

💸 For DS105L, my teammates and I are currently working on a project analysing the impact of **education** on salary and job in the United States of America: stay tuned for more!

🐍 Currently trying to improve my Pyhton and Tableau skills. 

## What comes next?

❓ I would like to explore more the theme of Artificial Intelligence and ethics or the tensions in the [semiconductor market](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63995570).

🗄️ I would like to expand my knowledge on SQL and R soon. 

🤝 If you would like to collaborate, drop me an email at [albertomartino.it@gmail.com](mailto:albertomartino.it@gmail.com)!
